# Font2Frame-Image-Generator
Font 2 Frame Image Generator is a simple yet powerful web-based tool that transforms textual descriptions into stunning AI-generated images. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool leverages Hugging Face's open-source APIs to generate images based on user prompts.

How It Works

Click 'Generate Image': The application sends a request to the Hugging Face API.

AI Processes the Request: The API returns a generated image based on the description.

View & Download: The generated image is displayed in the results section and can be saved by the user.

History Tracking: Previous prompts are stored for quick reuse.
